## Swarthmore Computer Club ðŸ¤“

We're a small local [computer club](https://startacomputer.club/).
Intended for computing professionals and enthusiasts, we meet once a month in Nicole's garage.

Our activities include:

- Discussions of all things computing
- Collaborating on software projects
- Talking about _non_ computing things
- Drinking good coffee
